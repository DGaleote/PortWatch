# 📦 PortWatch – Portable Distributions

This directory contains **ready-to-run portable distributions** of PortWatch for each supported operating system.

These distributions are designed to be:
- fully self-contained
- executable without installing Java
- suitable for use from removable media (USB drive)
- consistent across platforms

Each distribution includes:
- the PortWatch executable
- a minimal Java runtime
- all required dependencies

All data generated by PortWatch (snapshots and diffs) is stored locally next to the executable.
